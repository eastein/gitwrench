# Workflow Tools

These tools are for streamlining git based workflows that I find useful.

# gitwrench

Given a path, find subdirectories that are git repositories and analyze them for push, commit, and remotes status.  Eventually I'd like to be able to automate taking action, but for now it just analyzes working copies.  Another feature I would like to add is the ability to integrate with git-svn, and to be able to determine that the remote master would get changes if it were pulled from, and to support tracking branches other than master.
